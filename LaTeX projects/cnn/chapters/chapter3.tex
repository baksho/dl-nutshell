\chapter{Building Blocks of CNNs}\label{chp:3}
To understand how CNNs work, it’s crucial to break down their architecture into core components. These blocks — \textbf{Convolutional Layers}, \textbf{Pooling Layers}, \textbf{Activation Functions}, \textbf{Fully Connected Layers}, and \textbf{Dropout Layers} — work together to extract and classify patterns in data.

\section{Convolutional Layers: The Core Component}
The convolutional layer is the most fundamental building block of CNNs. It is responsible for detecting spatial features (e.g., edges, textures) by applying a \textbf{kernel} or \textbf{filter} to the input data.
